      <header>About JavaScript</header>
      <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.</p>
      <p>It was developed in just 10 days for Netscape Navigator.</p>
      <p>Originally, it was called Mocha, then LiveScript, before becoming JavaScript.</p>
      <p>In 1996, JavaScript was submitted to ECMA for standardization.</p>
      <p>Over time, it has become one of the most popular languages for web development.</p>
      <code>console.log("Hello, World!")</code>

      <header>Introduction to JavaScript</header>
      <p>JavaScript is a programming language used for web development.</p>
      <p>It runs in browsers to create interactive websites.</p>
      <p>JavaScript can modify HTML and CSS elements dynamically.</p>
      <p>It supports both client-side and server-side development.</p>
      <p>With JavaScript, you can build responsive and user-friendly interfaces.</p>
      <code>alert("Hello, World!");</code>
      <p>Examples of function codes in JavaScript:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>function add</li>
        <li>function isEven</li>
        <li>function greet</li>

      <header>About to Java</header>
      <p>Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995.</p>
      <p>It was initially called Oak, but later renamed Java.</p>
      <p>Java was designed to be platform-independent, running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
      <p>Its "write once, run anywhere" capability made it popular for various applications.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and took over Java's development.</p>
      <p>CSS allows you to customize fonts, colors, spacing, and more.</p>

      <p>JavaScript is a scripting language for web development.</p>
      <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code.</p>
      <code>System.out.println("Hello, World!")</code>
      <p>They can take inputs, called parameters, and return values.</p>

      <header>JavaScript vs Java</header>
      <p>JavaScript is primarily used for web development, while Java is used for various applications.</p>
      <p>JavaScript runs in browsers, whereas Java runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
      <p>JavaScript is interpreted, but Java is compiled into bytecode.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is weakly typed, while Java is strongly typed.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is event-driven and mainly client-side, while Java is class-based and supports both client and server-side.</p>
      <code>console.log("Hello, World!"); vs. System.out.println("Hello, World!");</code>
